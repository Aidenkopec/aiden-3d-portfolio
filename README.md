# Aiden Kopec 3D Portfolio
This project is a fusion of cutting-edge technologies, bringing a powerful and visually-stunning 3D experience to life. It makes use of ThreeJS, a robust 3D graphics library, to render and animate the 3D models with ease. Additionally, React Three Fiber, a popular library for creating 3D graphics in React, provides an intuitive and seamless integration with ThreeJS.

To enhance the visual appeal of the project, TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS styling framework, has been implemented, allowing for easy customization and maintenance of the design. Additionally, Framer Motion, the most popular library for adding animations to React websites, has been utilized to add captivating and dynamic elements.

In this project, you will learn to create, load and customize stunning 3D models and geometries with various lighting effects, as well as gain a deeper understanding of the 3D world with camera and object positioning in space. You will also gain proficiency in implementing practices, such as Higher Order Components (HOCs), to make your code reusable and scalable.

Moreover, this project includes the implementation of a contact form to send emails through the website. To ensure seamless user experience, the website is designed to be responsive across all devices, and advanced techniques such as Suspense and Preload are employed to improve the site's performance.
